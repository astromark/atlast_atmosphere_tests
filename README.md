Jupyter notebooks to test how we include the atmosphere in the AtLAST Sensitivity Calculator.

atmosphere_tests_scv1.ipynb - runs tests in the AtLAST Sensitivity Calculator: https://github.com/ukatc/AtLAST_sensitivity_calculator
atmosphere_tests_amexternal.ipynb - runs tests external to the calculator and directly on the output of the am code - useful for checking that something else in the calculator was causing the problem and for running tests on different am code outputs without needing to change anything in the calculator
atmosphere_tests_atm.ipynb - runs similar tests in casa using the atm code to check how those results compare
